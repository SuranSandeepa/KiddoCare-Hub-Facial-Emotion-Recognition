Emotion Recognition Model
Overview
This repository contains the code for an emotion recognition model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to recognize emotions from facial expressions using the FER2013 dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which includes facial expression images categorized into seven emotions.

## CNN Architecture
The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. Training and validation accuracy are visualized using matplotlib.
